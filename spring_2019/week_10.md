## Last Week's Accomplishments

* Looking at code for wire deletion

## This Week's Plan

I continued looking on Tuesday, and I presented today, so I didn't get a chance to start working on Wire Port deletion. I will probably start working on it next Tuesday.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing is blocking.
