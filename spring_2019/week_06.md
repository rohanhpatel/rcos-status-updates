## Last Week's Accomplishments

* Finished 2 out of 3 tool tests
* Working on the third test for Friday

## This Week's Plan

I finished the Selection Tool, and I'm now working on the Wiring Tool. A big problem is that the port doesn't seem to be in the place it's supposed to be in.

## Anything Blocking?

Nope
