## Last Week's Accomplishments

* Converted code for constant high and constant low from JavaScript to TypeScript
* Worked on unit test for constant high and low, but it was implemented by another person

## This Week's Plan

I've been working on the clock, which is an input in the circuit that turns on and off with a certain frequency. After finishing the clock, I also have to make a unit test to see if the code works.

## Anything Blocking?

I'm not that well experienced with TypeScript, so I will keep on trying to learn TypeScript, and refreshing the little JavaScript I've learned.
