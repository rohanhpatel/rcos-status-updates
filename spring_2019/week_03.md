## Last Week's Accomplishments

* Pushed code to GitHub
* Started working on Tool tests

## This Week's Plan

I have 3 tests to code for different tools that the user can use to interact with the website.

## Anything Blocking?

I'm getting better with TypeScript, but it still needs work, and I'm learning by looking at more code.
