## Last Week's Accomplishments

* Started working on Tool tests

## This Week's Plan

I have 3 tests to code for different tools that the user can use to interact with the website, and I've started with the Selection Tool which allows the user to select anything that's on the screen.

## Anything Blocking?

I'm getting better with TypeScript, but it still needs work, and I'm learning by looking at more code.
