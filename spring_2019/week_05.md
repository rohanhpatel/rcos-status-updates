## Last Week's Accomplishments

* Finished 1 out of 3 tool tests
* Working on the second and third tests for Tuesday

## This Week's Plan

I decided to ditch the Selection Tool test before, and I finished the Translate Tool test. The Translate Tool allows the user to move objects in the scene around. I am going to work mainly on the Wiring Tool test today, and my goal is to finish these tests by the end of Tuesday.

## Anything Blocking?

I took the time to learn TypeScript over break, so I now have a better understanding of TypeScript than I did before.
