## Last Week's Accomplishments

* Converted code for clock from JavaScript to TypeScript
* Worked on unit test for clock

## This Week's Plan

I want to get an assignment from Leon, and then hopefully make some progress, as well as push my updates to the repo for OpenCircuits.

## Anything Blocking?

I'm getting better with TypeScript, but I still need to work on it.
